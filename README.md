# todo.txt-mit

This is a reimplementation of the [MIT add-on](https://github.com/codybuell/mit) for [`todo.txt-cli`](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/) in Ruby.

The main reason for this reimplementation's existence is that I agree with the original author that [it would be nice if the add-on was faster](https://github.com/codybuell/mit/blob/d4fbdd203f04098ff8cfcd39a6fa8bb3226b6b03/mit#L49).

## Installation

Clone this repo and copy the [`mit`](mit) file into your add-on folder;
ordinarily the folder name will be `~/.todo.actions.d` (see [Installing Addons](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/Creating-and-Installing-Add-ons) for more information).
